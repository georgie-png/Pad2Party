# Pad2Party

A fun bit of code that turns pads into mermaid graphs. This is still an early messy edition, and will be updated when we have more time . . . . to be more user friendly/customisable.

For now, do test it out live [HERE](https://georgie-png.github.io/etherpad-vis/)

## ToDos
- [X] Making styling dynamic
- [ ] Making UI ex: buttons, default page for input to name the pad 
- [ ] Settings header (radomness)
- [ ] Adding custom fonts
- [ ] Adding images 
- [ ] Adding filters
- [ ] Turn colors from grey scale to rgb splitting by brackets
- [ ] Take multiple inputs for styling/other settings splitting by commas
- [ ] Get it to recursively update from the pad
- [ ] Beat detection
- [ ] Using npm in js (1. sliders 2.draggables->can be maximise/ minimise)
